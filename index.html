        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>As a front-end developer leveraging ReactJS, my primary focus for the next two years is to enhance my skills and contribute to impactful projects. Here are my specific goals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Master ReactJS and Advanced JavaScript:</strong> I aim to become proficient in ReactJS along with advanced JavaScript concepts such as ES6+ features, state management with Redux or Context API, and asynchronous programming.</li>
            <li><strong>Develop Responsive and Accessible Web Applications:</strong> Utilizing React's component-based architecture, I will create responsive and accessible web applications that provide a seamless user experience across all devices and assistive technologies.</li>
            <li><strong>Contribute to Open Source React Projects:</strong> Engaging with the React community through contributions to open-source projects on platforms like GitHub. This will not only improve my coding skills but also allow me to collaborate with developers worldwide.</li>
            <li><strong>Build Scalable and Performant React Applications:</strong> I will focus on optimizing performance by implementing best practices such as code splitting, lazy loading, and efficient data fetching techniques with tools like React Query or Apollo Client.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Updated with React Ecosystem:</strong> Given the rapid evolution of React and its ecosystem, I commit to staying updated with the latest trends, libraries, and best practices by attending conferences, workshops, and online courses.</li>
